This strategy will isolate the older technology from the broader network, reducing its exposure to external threats and minimizing the impact of any security vulnerabilities.\n  *  Deploy a StrideLinx secure VPN platform: AutomationDirect also recommends placing the system behind a StrideLinx VPN platform.\n\n\nThese mitigation strategies provide a comprehensive approach to managing the risks associated with the H2-DM1E while preparing for future security needs.
